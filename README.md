# Learning Hour

## Objective
You all went through a pretty fast-paced introduction to programming earlier in the summer.  This is a chance to slow down and practice the basics. In addition, I will help build knowledge on additional concepts that are foundational to working effectively (version control (git, GitHub), operating system concepts, debugging, ).

## Agenda
There are 3 parallel tracks followed by end of course project. I am planning to group classes in 12 week blocks.  This will allow us to have a bit of a break between blocks, and also allow us to have a bit of a celebration at the end of each block. Assuming kids like the format and want to continue, we'll have follow-on blocks with progressively advanced concepts.

I haven't run such a class before, so I'm not sure how it will go.  I'm open to feedback and suggestions.  I'm also open to changing the format if it's not working for the kids.

#### What language will be learning? 
We'll be learning Kotlin. It is a JVM Language.  It is a modern language that is easy to learn and has a lot of features that make it easy to write code. You don't need to setup an IDE. You can play with it at https://play.kotlinlang.org/. When it makes sense, in order to learn a concept and compare across languages, we'll do that. 

### Class Structure

| Time          | Track                                 | 
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| 16:00 - 16:15 | Track 1: News and Events              |
| 16:15 - 16:45 | Track 2: Programming Concepts         |
| 16:45 - 17:00 | Track 3: Concepts in Computer Science | 
| 17:00 - 17:30 | Track 4: Help with code               |


### Track 1: News and Events (15 minutes)
This is an opportunity to share what's going on in the world of technology.  I'll share some of the things I've been reading about, and we can discuss.  I'll also share some of the events that are coming up that might be of interest. Examples of interesting things to talk about are Chat-GPT and are Robots going to take over our jobs? 

The goal of this track is to help build a habit of staying current with what's going on in the world of technology.  This is a skill that will serve you well in your career.

Each of you will be called upon to share what you've learned. There are no wrong answers.  If you don't have anything to share, that's fine.  If you do, great.  If you're not sure, that's fine too.  We'll work together to figure it out.

### Track 2: Programming Concepts (30 minutes)
We'll go into core/basic programming concepts like `variables`, `primitive data structures`, `immutable vs mutable`, `control flow structures`, `classes`. We won't do more advanced concepts just yet. 

### Track 3: Concepts in Computer Science (15 minutes)
One of the first classes will cover things like `interpreted` vs `compiled` languages. We'll review `weakly typed` vs `strongly typed` languages once we cover primites and variables. We may even do something basic comparisons of variables and declarations in `Python` vs `Kotlin` and break code in `Python` to show how it is weakly typed or showcase benefits of `strongly typed` in large systems.

We'll go into core/basic concepts in computer science like `algorithms`, `data structures`, some basic `operating systems` particularly around conceptual models of allocating memory (it is useful to understand in conjuction with variables). 

We'll also go over the age-old question of `What's the best way to do X`? and explore why `It depends` is the right answer.  We'll also explore the concept of `trade-offs` and how to think about them. I don't expect kids to be able to remember this, but I want to introduce the concepts and help them start thinking about them. Life is almost never a binary choice. It's almost always a trade-off.  I want to help them start thinking about trade-offs and how to make decisions.

### Track 4: Help with code (30 minutes)
Given kids are starting middle school, I don't want to saddle them with extra homework. Instead, we'll do a session to answer questions  and help with code.  Kids can bring in code they're working on and we'll work through it together.  We'll also use this time to help with homework assignments.  I'll also use this time to help with any questions they have about the concepts we've covered in the other tracks.

### Team project
At the end, we'll embark on building a bot that we'll deploy to the cloud. It will be able to understand some commands and respond. We'll use this as a way to practice working together as a team, and also to practice the concepts we've learned. They'll need a fair bit of help and won't be ready to do this on their own.  We'll work together to figure it out.

### Follow up
Once we conclude Track 4, let's review on what went well, and what we'd like to change.  We'll use that to inform the next block of classes. Assuming kids like it, I plan to continue doing it, as there are younger siblings and the content we develop will be useful for them as well.

## Logistics
I am open to reviewing what works for you all.  Here's what I'm thinking for now:
* We'll meet every Sunday at 4pm for 1.5 hours.  It will be in person at our home.
* We may change up the schedule based on kids' soccer schedules.  We'll figure it out.
* Horror-horror, kids will take notes on a piece of paper, the old-fashioned way. They can transcribe later on a computer. I want to ensure they are attentive in class and not distracted by technology.

There's a secondary objective of helping kids learn how to take notes.  It will help them in their careers.

The final reason is that developing software requires keeping a fair bit knowledge in your head.  I want to help them develop that skill. I want to help them learn how to keep a lot of information in their head and be able to recall it when needed.  This is a skill that will serve them well in whatever career they pick. It is especially important if they pick any type of software development. (*hint* *hint*) There's a reason why things like Chat GPT will not replace humans.

### Cost
There's no cost for the class.  I'm doing this because I enjoy teaching and I want to help kids learn.  I'm also doing this to help my kids learn.  I'm not a professional teacher, so I'm not sure how it will go.  I'm open to feedback and suggestions.  I'm also open to changing the format if it's not working for the kids.

### Equipment
There's no need to buy a new computer. As long as you have a computer that can connect to the internet, you're good to go.  If you have a computer that can't connect to the internet, we can work around that too.  We'll figure it out.

If there's no computer, that's not an issue either.  We can work around that too.  I can read code on a piece of paper and evaluate.

### Homework
There's no homework.  I want to make this fun and engaging.  I don't want to add to the homework load.  If you want to do homework, I can give you some ideas.  But it's not required. Each class we'll have a 30 minute block to help with homework.

### What if I can't make it to a class?
I will be transcribing the notes for a class ideally every Saturday before the class.  I'll post them on GitHub.  You can review them and catch up.  If you have questions, we can go over them in the next class. If you have questions before the next class, you can email me and I'll try to answer them.

If you miss a class, we can go over the notes in the next class.  If you have questions, we can go over them in the next class. If you have questions before the next class, you can email me and I'll try to answer them.

### What if I have questions?
You can email me at [nasir@rasul.ca](mailto:nasir@rasul.ca)

### Respect school breaks
If during our class, there's a school break, we'll take a break too.  I want to ensure kids have time to relax and recharge.  I don't want to add to their stress.  I want to make this fun and engaging.  I don't want to add to the homework load.  

### What if I have a question about something we didn't cover in class?
I am happy to answer generic questions about anything in the first `15` minute block. 

### Travel Break
I need to travel sometime in fall, but I don't have a timeline yet. I'll let you know when I have more details. If I'm not in town, we'll take a break.
