You are to write a program that will take a list of names. If it matches one of the planets, it will provide a message.
In the event, it doesn't, it will return a different message.

Mercury: It's the first planet.
Venus: It's the second planet.
Earth: We live on this planet.
Mars: It's the fourth planet.
Jupiter: It's the fifth planet.
Saturn: It's the sixth planet.
Uranus: It's the seventh planet.
Neptune: It's the last planet in the solar system.
Pluto: It is not considered a planet anymore.
Any other value should state that we are expecting planet names in our solar system.


Hint: You'll need to use the case statement we learnt the `when` statement in lesson 7/8.


example:

The full form is as below...
```
fun lesson7aGreet(age: Int) {
    when {
        age < 10 -> println("secret kid greeting - Your age is $age")
        age == 10 -> println("Congratulations. You are exactly a 10")
        age > 10 -> println("hello - Your age is $age")
    }
}
```

You may find it easier to use the shortened form.

fun planetName(name: String) {
    when (name) {
        "<somename>" -> println("some message")
        "<someOthername>" -> println("some message")
        else -> println("handles all other undefined cases")
    }
}
